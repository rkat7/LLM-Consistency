# LLM Consistency Verifier

A proof-of-concept implementation of formal verification for large language model (LLM) output consistency.

## Overview

This project implements a neural-symbolic verification system that ensures the consistency of LLM-generated outputs by:

1. Extracting logical rules and assertions from LLM responses
2. Representing these in a formal logic system
3. Performing automated verification to detect logical inconsistencies
4. Providing corrective feedback to the LLM to address identified inconsistencies

## Architecture

The system consists of four main components:

### 1. Neural-Symbolic Interface Layer
Extracts logical rules and assertions from natural language outputs of LLMs.

### 2. Formal Verification Engine
Uses symbolic reasoning techniques to verify logical consistency.

### 3. Dynamic Repair Mechanism
Generates corrective feedback for identified inconsistencies.

### 4. Real-Time Processing Pipeline
Enables efficient verification during LLM interaction.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/llm_consistency_verifier.git
cd llm_consistency_verifier
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```python
from llm_consistency_verifier import ConsistencyVerifier

# Initialize the verifier
verifier = ConsistencyVerifier()

# Verify consistency of LLM responses
response = "All birds can fly. Penguins are birds. Penguins cannot fly."
verification_result = verifier.verify(response)

# Get results
if verification_result.is_consistent:
    print("Response is logically consistent")
else:
    print("Inconsistencies detected:")
    for inconsistency in verification_result.inconsistencies:
        print(f"- {inconsistency}")
    
    # Get corrected response
    corrected_response = verifier.repair(response)
    print(f"Corrected response: {corrected_response}")
```
